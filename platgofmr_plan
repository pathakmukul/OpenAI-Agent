## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to build an agent platform where multiple agents can be stored, managed, and invoked as needed. The platform will allow users to create and store their own agents, configure master prompts, choose between different Language Model (LLM) integrations, and provide a testing environment for agent evaluation.

---

## 2. Project Overview

The agent platform aims to provide a flexible and scalable solution for managing AI agents that can automate complex tasks. Users can:

- Create and store custom agents.
- Configure master prompts tailored to their requirements.
- Select from various LLM models.
- Test agents in a controlled environment.

---

## 3. Core Requirements

1. **Agent Storage and Retrieval**: Ability to store multiple agents and retrieve them dynamically.
2. **Master Prompt Configuration**: Option to set and customize master prompts per user requirement.
3. **User-Created Agents**: Users can create, store, and manage their own agents.
4. **LLM Model Flexibility**: Support for different LLM models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, custom models).
5. **Testing Environment**: Provide a sandbox environment for testing agents before deployment.

---

## 4. System Architecture

The platform will be designed with a modular architecture comprising the following layers:

- **Frontend Layer**: User interface for interaction.
- **Backend Layer**: Business logic, agent management, and API endpoints.
- **Database Layer**: Persistent storage for agents, user data, and configurations.
- **LLM Integration Layer**: Abstraction layer to interface with different LLM models.
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated environment for agent testing.
